# vim-tmux-conf

Syntax highlighting for tmux configuration files.

## What it does

*Exactly* as advertised:
some rudimentary **syntax highlighting** for the `tmux.conf` file.
Well not entirely, it now does just a teensy bit more: **tmux command execution**.

When writing your `tmux.conf`-file you'll probably want to try things out.
However always sourcing the tmux configuration after saving can be a
hassle, even if you've created a *source my configuration*-mapping.
Now you can just execute specific lines at will. They will be directly
applied on your currently running tmux sessions.

- Pressing `te` (read: *tmux execute*) on a line in normal mode will execute
  that line and open a one-line buffer with the output.
  - You can quit close the buffer by just pressing `q` in normal mode
- Pressing `tes` (read: *tmux execute silently/shut up*) on a line in normal
  mode will just execute that line...

### Configuration

Per default we will just execute the `tmux` command. However if your
PATH is setup differently, you can just set the path to the executable
manually in your vimrc:
```vim
let g:tmux_command = "/path/to/my/tmux"
```

Per default the height of the output-window will be exactly one line.
However if you regularly experience output which presents across
multiple lines you can increase the size (again in your vimrc):
```vim
let g:tmux_default_buffer_height = 2
```
